Reviva - Capture Your Moments
Reviva is a unique journaling application designed to help you recognize and reflect on your achievements. By automatically summarizing your daily accomplishments and providing AI-driven feedback, Reviva tracks your emotional trends and offers personalized insights to help you stay motivated.

üåü Project Overview
Have you ever felt low even after hitting milestones in your personal or professional life? Have you wondered why that happens? Maybe we forget those accomplishments or feel like they weren‚Äôt big enough‚Ä¶ or sometimes, there‚Äôs no one around to acknowledge them.

What if there was an app that immediately recognizes your achievements, reminds you of them every week, and even tracks your emotional trends with clear analysis?

That‚Äôs how the idea of "Reviva - Capture your moments" was born! üå±

The app is simple to use and provides uplifting feedback using the power of AI. Built using the MERN stack, Reviva integrates Google LLMs and Hugging Face Models to offer feedback and sentiment analysis.

‚ú® Main Features
Achievement Recognition: Track your accomplishments and get regular reminders of your progress.
Emotional Trend Analysis: View detailed insights into your emotional patterns over time.
AI-driven Journal Summaries & Feedback: Summarized journals with motivating feedback from AI based on your entries.
Weekly Notifications: Receive weekly emails summarizing your accomplishments and key moments from the week. (Note: Notification feature is still under development)
